# Team-Quasar
<<<<<<< HEAD
Hi we are Kyaw Hein, Kenny Lee Fujioka, and Jaimie Obatake. We make up Team Quasar!

I'm Jaimie the lone female for Team Quasar! I love to cook, bake, and watch J-Dramas with my sister in my free time. I'm very excited to get this semester going and create a weatherbox. :) Let's work well together!

I'm Kyaw Hein, one of the members of the team, who are planning to complete a fully functioning weatherbox by the end of the Spring semester. I am currently a sophomore at UH Manoa, majoring in Electrical Engineering, but I do not know which track I want to major in yet. I do not have anything interesting about me, but my hobbies are video games, soccer, anime and reading.
