# Team-Quasar

Hello! and Welcom to Team Quasar.

I'm Kyaw Hein, one of the members of the team, who are planning to complete a fully functioning weatherbox by the end of the Spring semester. I am currently a sophomore at UH Manoa, majoring in Electrical Engineering, but I do not know which track I want to major in yet. I do not have anything interesting about me, but my hobbies are video games, soccer, anime and reading.
