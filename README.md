# Team-Quasar
Hi we are Kyaw Hein, Kenny Lee Fujioka, and Jaimie Obatake. We make up Team Quasar!

I'm Jaimie the lone female for Team Quasar! I love to cook, bake, and watch J-Dramas with my sister in my free time. I'm very excited to get this semester going and create a weatherbox. :) Let's work well together!
